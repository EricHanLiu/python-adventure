# Python Adventure Game

A text based adventure game loosely inspired by Majora's Mask (Legend of Zelda)

## How to run

1. Clone the repository and run **main.py**
  - Type `python main.py` in terminal
2. The game will run within the terminal
3. You may need to resize the terminal very slightly to display all the features

## How to play
All the information is accessible within the game, using the help module (type 'H' within the game)
Dying will reset the game (yet to implement the save feature used on my old java Zelda game).
